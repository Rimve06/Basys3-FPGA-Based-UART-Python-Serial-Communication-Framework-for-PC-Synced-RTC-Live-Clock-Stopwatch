# Basys3-FPGA-Based-UART-Python-Serial-Communication-Framework-for-PC-Synced-RTC-Live-Clock-Stopwatch
The project here intends to demonstrate a simple but useful experiment on low level hardware-software communication.It integrates Verilog as the hardware description language, Python as the software communication interface, and the Basys3 FPGA board as the primary hardware controller.
